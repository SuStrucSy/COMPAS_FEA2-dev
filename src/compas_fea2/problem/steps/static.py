class StaticStep(GeneralStep):
    """StaticStep for use in a static analysis.

    Parameters
    ----------
    max_increments : int
        Max number of increments to perform during the case step.
        (Typically 100 but you might have to increase it in highly non-linear
        problems. This might increase the analysis time.).
    initial_inc_size : float
        Sets the the size of the increment for the first iteration.
        (By default is equal to the total time, meaning that the software decrease
        the size automatically.)
    min_inc_size : float
        Minimum increment size before stopping the analysis.
        (By default is 1e-5, but you can set a smaller size for highly non-linear
        problems. This might increase the analysis time.)
    time : float
        Total time of the case step. Note that this not actual 'time',
        but rather a proportionality factor. (By default is 1, meaning that the
        analysis is complete when all the increments sum up to 1)
    nlgeom : bool
        if ``True`` nonlinear geometry effects are considered.
    modify : bool
        if ``True`` the loads applied in a previous step are substituted by the
        ones defined in the present step, otherwise the loads are added.

    Attributes
    ----------
    name : str
        Automatically generated id. You can change the name if you want a more
        human readable input file.
    max_increments : int
        Max number of increments to perform during the case step.
        (Typically 100 but you might have to increase it in highly non-linear
        problems. This might increase the analysis time.).
    initial_inc_size : float
        Sets the the size of the increment for the first iteration.
        (By default is equal to the total time, meaning that the software decrease
        the size automatically.)
    min_inc_size : float
        Minimum increment size before stopping the analysis.
        (By default is 1e-5, but you can set a smaller size for highly non-linear
        problems. This might increase the analysis time.)
    time : float
        Total time of the case step. Note that this not actual 'time',
        but rather a proportionality factor. (By default is 1, meaning that the
        analysis is complete when all the increments sum up to 1)
    nlgeom : bool
        if ``True`` nonlinear geometry effects are considered.
    modify : bool
        if ``True`` the loads applied in a previous step are substituted by the
        ones defined in the present step, otherwise the loads are added.
    loads : dict
        Dictionary of the loads assigned to each part in the model in the step.
    displacements : dict
        Dictionary of the displacements assigned to each part in the model in the step.
